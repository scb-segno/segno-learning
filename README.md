# Segno Learning

## Description
This app connects music teachers and students, advancing learning by sharing goals and resources in support of in-person lessons.

Progressing with a musical instrument or singing happens between lessons. Every lesson is an opportunity to guide, teach, and correct mistakes. But true improvements take place in the crucial hours spent in practice.

Segno Learning bridges the gap between those lessons. It allows ongoing guidance to students, ensuring they are focusing on the right concepts and exercising their skills in the most beneficial way possible.

Despite advances educational technology, many private music schools and academies rely on oudated, sluggish options. These typically do not account for the specialized needs of learning music, forcing students and teachers to make the best of what they have available.

While limitations can breed creativity, Segno aims to make every practice session count. Teachers can easily provide practice materials, including sheet music and tablation, videos of exercises and techniques, and reference audio files that keep students moving in the right direction.

This all-in-one platform continues to develop every tool a music and performing arts academy needs: lesson and recital scheduling for multiple campus locations, billing, simple individual and mass communication, teacher availability, and easy management of students' progress, instruments, and resources.
